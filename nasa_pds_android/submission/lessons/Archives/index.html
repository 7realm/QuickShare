                        FITS Format Information<br><br>
    All data were submitted to the International Halley Watch Lead Center on
magnetic tape, written in FITS or ascii format.  There are three primary
references to basic FITS (Wells et al, 1981) and its extensions (Greisen and
Harten, 1981, Harten et al, 1988).  Although commonly viewed as a magnetic
tape format, the actual FITS specifications can be interpreted to describe a
general byte stream.  As such, FITS files may be written on any storage
medium, including CD-ROM.  Note that there is no inherent record structure
called for in the FITS agreements, only a blocking structure for block
oriented media such as magnetic tape.<br><br>
    The basic FITS agreements call for only a few required keywords (SIMPLE,
BITPIX, NAXIS, END must be present; EXTEND may appear; keywords NAXIS1, ...,
NAXISn appear as defined by the value of NAXIS).  We have also followed
recommended conventions for the representation of values of keywords (dates in
the format 'dd/mm/yy', SI units used where possible, etc.).  The IHW has
defined an additional set of mandatory keywords for all submissions to the
Lead Center.  These are presented in the table below:<br><br>
    OBJECT   - Name of the object in the data file, a text string.
    FILE-NUM - Unique 6-digit number of the file submitted to the Lead Center.
               The first digit identifies the discipline, the other digits are
               assigned by the individual Disciplines, but must uniquely
               identify the file.
    DATE-OBS - UT Date of mid-observation, in the format 'dd/mm/yy'.
    TIME-OBS - UT Time of mid-observation, as fractional day.
    DATE-REL - IHW internal release date for data, as date string.
    DISCIPLN - Name of the network submitting the file, a text string.
    LONG-OBS - Longitude of the submitting observatory, in the format
               'ddd/mm/ss', with degrees from 0 to 360, increasing in the
               eastward sense.
<br>    LAT--OBS - Latitude of the submitting observatory, in the format<br>
               'sdd/mm/ss'.
    SYSTEM   - An 8-digit coded character string identifying the Discipline,
               observatory and instrument which supplied the data. The first
               character identifies the network, the next three identify the
               observatory (by IAU code number, where one is assigned, 500
               otherwise). The next four digits either identify the
               telescope/instrument combination (if there is an IAU number for
               the observatory) or the country and observatory (if no IAU
               number).
    OBSERVER - Name of the observer(s) who took the data, a text string. The
               notation "ET AL." indicates that there were more than two
               observers, and the names of the additional observers are given
               in a COMMENT later in the header, with the subkeyword "ADD.
               OBS."
    SUBMITTR - Name of the person submitting the data to the Lead Center, a
               text string.
    SPEC-EVT - A logical value indicating that the observation is a special
               event.  Either T or F.
    DAT-FORM - A character string defining the form of the data, e.g.,
               'ASCII', 'NODATA'.<br><br>

                               PDS LABELS<br><br>
     The International Halley Watch agreed early in the project that all data
would be submitted from the individual scientists to the Lead Center using
the FITS format (Wells et al., 1981).  When the decision was made to
distribute this information on CD-ROM, it was determined that the data had to
have even broader accessibility.  For this reason the original FITS files,
with contiguous headers and data, were split into separate files
distinguishable by their filename extensions (.HDR for headers).  The file
sizes were preserved as multiples of 2880 bytes, allowing the original FITS
byte stream to be recovered by concatenating the appropriate header and
datafile.<br><br>
     In addition, detached (PDS) labels were constructed to allow parallel
definition of the data files for the Planetary Data System (PDS). The
reference for this project are as follows: SPIDS, Standards for the
Preparation and Interchange of Data Sets, Martin, T. Z., et al, V1.1, JPL
D-4683, 10/3/88; Planetary Data System, Data Preparation Workbook, Volume 2,
Standards, V2.0, JPL D-7669, 05/03/91; and Planetary Data System, Standards
Reference, V3.0, JPL D-7669, part 2, 11/20/92.<br><br>
     There are three data objects in this archive: ARRAY (COLLECTION), IMAGE,
TABLE (TIME_SERIES as a subset).  Our aim was to construct a PDS label for
each data file on the CD-ROM. These PDS labels contain pointers to the actual
data files (or to headers describing data submitted to the archive). There has
been no effort to duplicate the documentation contained in the full FITS
headers because the PDS and FITS headers for a given data file differ only in
the filename extension.  Instead we have attempted to use the power of the PDS
label syntax to fully describe the data structures and thus gain access to the
powerful software already supported by that group.<br><br>
     Most keywords were already in the Planetary Science Data Dictionary but a
few dealing with the ARRAY and TIME_SERIES were introduced to specifically
describe the IHW data.   A listing of these keywords with definitions follow.<br><br>
